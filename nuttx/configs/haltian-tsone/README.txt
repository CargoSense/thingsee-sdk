This NuttX configuration is for the Haltian Thingsee One board.

This configuration has been tested with "GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors"
toolchain: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

Thingsee One is generic platform for HW and SW development in IOT. It
includes several different connectivity modules, sensors, mass memories, power
management and interfaces for test and debugging purposes. It can be easily
expanded with other modules as there are test pads for access I2C, SPI and UART
as well as for supporting GPIOs. There are power supply and GND pads for powering
the external device.  Here is a list of the key components and features:
