This folder can be used to host platform level testcases. Testcases are collected from the codebase
post-build. They are packaged and exposed for further use as a build artifact. The process is assisted
by GIT [repo](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/) tool and a manifest.

Every testcase is identified by its path and interpretation of the path is different depending on the
test framework in use. But few concepts always hold true:

* Every testcase belongs to a testsuite
* A testsuite may belong to a testsuite or be a top level testsuite
* Top level testsuite belongs to a collection of top level testsuites
* Test identification is built like a file path, where components are separated with slashes (/)
* Right-most component of the identification is the testcase name
* Folder structure may contribute to the testcase identification
    * Example for [py.test](http://pytest.org/latest/): `a/b/c/d/e/test_f` is translated to `a/b/c/d/e.py::test_f`
